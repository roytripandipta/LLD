# Food Ordering System Design (Like Swiggy/Zomato)

## System Design Overview

The system is divided into several key components:

1. **User Management**: This component handles user registration, login, and profile management. Users can be customers or restaurant owners, each with different roles and permissions.

2. **Restaurant Management**: This component manages the profiles of restaurants, including the details of the restaurant, menu management, and availability status.

3. **Menu Management**: This handles the creation, updating, and availability of menu items that restaurants offer to customers.

4. **Order Processing**: This component is responsible for handling order creation, updating order statuses, and tracking the orders from placement to delivery.

5. **Payment Processing**: This handles the payment transactions, ensuring secure and smooth processing for various payment methods (e.g., credit cards, PayPal, UPI).

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Singleton Pattern

- **Purpose**: The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Application**: In the system, the Singleton pattern is used for the `DatabaseConnection` class, ensuring that only one connection instance to the database exists throughout the application, optimizing resource usage.

### 2. Factory Pattern

- **Purpose**: The Factory pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. It provides a way to delegate the instantiation of objects to a factory class.
- **Application**: The `UserFactory` and `OrderFactory` classes use the Factory pattern to create instances of `User` (either Customer or Restaurant Owner) and `Order` respectively. This allows for the flexible and centralized creation of objects.

### 3. Observer Pattern

- **Purpose**: The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, where if one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Application**: The `OrderStatusObserver` interface and its implementations (e.g., `UserInterface`, `DeliverySystem`) use the Observer pattern to update the system components (such as the user interface and delivery system) when the order status changes.

### 4. Strategy Pattern

- **Purpose**: The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.
- **Application**: The `PaymentStrategy` interface and its concrete implementations (e.g., `CreditCardPayment`, `PaypalPayment`) use the Strategy pattern to support different payment methods. The `PaymentProcessor` class uses this pattern to dynamically choose the payment method at runtime.

### 5. Facade Pattern

- **Purpose**: The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with the system.
- **Application**: The `OrderProcessingFacade` class uses the Facade pattern to offer a simplified interface for the complex order processing subsystem. It encapsulates the operations of placing an order, processing payment, and updating order statuses, providing a streamlined API for the client.
